### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my profile! Although I am still a student, I do quite a bit of programming, mostly web applications, but they are in private repositories.
I run my site on a Debian 11 VPS, well, I'm trying to make things easier, for example with a recent project about automated SSH key generation. You can already find these projects public, as well as my upcoming Discord bot creation tool using Discord.js14!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python! It was the first language I learned, however I was stupid and thought it had no real use. 6 years later I return to him and love him more and more.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on more than one projects you can see the list below
  - My graduation thesis - Application for teaching the subject "financial literacy and investing".
  - SSH Key generator - I'm just lazy, so, this can help anyone like me to do not spend more than 2 minutes with generating SSH key and linking it to github.
  - Tool for creating Discord.js 14 bot easily
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? Definitely mail, just write me to admin@trnass.cz or try to contact me via [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/240787388945661952)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns? Hate this trend, there are just two genders and I am the most man one.
- âš¡ I'm student and programming is mine hobby, in addition to programming, I am also interested in world politics, psychology and phenomena on the financial market.
